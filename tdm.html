            <h1>Tdm basics</h1>
            <p>Tdming in sea of thives means fhiting another piret with the flintlock and sniper for some highe octane piret violance. This ussally acures on a Skull fort becuas of the bugy nature and diffrent geometric fetuers one can use to sureprise your opponent this is a very Funny way to play the game in my personal opinion. The bigest problem with Tdm in sea of thives is that it is not that populor and the communety can be cuite toxic.  </p>
            <h1> Tdm Rules</h1>
            <p>Flintlock + Sniper only</p>

            <p>Shoot high to island (fort)</p>

            <p>No water-shooting (this is where you shoot a person in the water, so if they bounce from their cannon shot you are to let them get to land or shoot back out again)</p>

            <p>No shooting players on their own boats</p>

            <p>No throwables</p>

            <p>Blackscreening your way out of a difficult situation is frowned upon.</p>
