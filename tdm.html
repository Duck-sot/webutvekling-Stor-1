            <h1>Tdm basics</h1>
            <p>Tdming in sea of thives means fhiting another piret with the flintlock and sniper for some highe octane piret violance.  This ussally acures on a Skull fort becuas of the bugy nature and diffrent geometric fetuers one can use to sureprise your opponent this is a very Funny way to play the game in my personal opinion. The bigest problem with Tdm in sea of thives is that it is not that populor and the communety can be cuite toxic.  </p>
            <h1> Tdm Rules</h1>
            <p>Flintlock + Sniper only</p>

            <p>Shoot high to island (fort)</p>

            <p>No water-shooting (this is where you shoot a person in the water, so if they bounce from their cannon shot you are to let them get to land or shoot back out again)</p>

            <p>No shooting players on their own boats</p>

            <p>No throwables</p>

            <p>Blackscreening your way out of a difficult situation is frowned upon.</p>

            <p> If you are in a 1v1 or 2v2 i have been told not to do air shoots so don't.</p>

            <p>No silent aim. </p>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>The first place i ever saw tdms were i arena (Arena was the previus pvp mode befor it got shut down in the beging of seson 7) the reson pepol tdmd in arena was becuas 
                you got points per kill and it lead to it gathering quite a followin with some pepol becuas of sots hand to hand was hard to find some where else. When the arena 
                closed the tdmers had to move to take over a server and go to a fort and this was a quite tedius proses  but that all chenged in the beging of seson 8.
            </p>
            <p>When seson 8 got released they introduced the houerglas and the tow Factions Gardiens of fortune and servents of the flame. In this new pvp two ships rise and fhitht 
                to the end were one sinks. When this released a new thing popt up calld campwars and that intaled that you kill echotehr with guns on your ship only using guns.
