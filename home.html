            <h1>The sea of thives</h1>
            <p>Sea of Thieves is a co-op and Player versus Player multiplayer game where players take on the role of Pirates sailing on the open sea looking for Treasure and battling each other. Players can sail alone or cooperate in up to 4-person Crews, picking up Quests and Voyages from various Trading Companies. Voyages involve sailing to various Locations to find buried Treasure, transporting various Trade Goods, battling Skeletons, or hunting Animals, Fish and other beasts. By completing voyages, players earn Gold and Reputation with various Trading Companies to work your way up to becoming a Pirate Legend.</p>
            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p>The game is focused on emergent gameplay. This means that Crews that encounter each other on the seas can choose how to play the game. They can battle it out for each other's gathered Treasure either in Ship to Ship combat by utilising the Ship's Cannons and clever maneuvering tricks, in Close Combat by utilizing a variety of Weapons. Alternatively, players can work together in Player Alliances and share all the hard-earned Treasure with all the Ship Crews in the Fleet. Players can also be interrupted by various Encounters, which include attacks by various creatures such as the Kraken and Megalodon, or NPC controlled Skeleton Ships. There are also various encounters which can occur on the islands such as Skeleton Forts or Ashen Winds (World Event). Alternatively, players can elect to play Tall Tales, which are story-based mission that take players around the map completing various objectives</p>
            <H1>An ecual playingfild</H1>
            <p>Sea of Thieves favours an equal playground where players can excel with their Skills and Wits instead of mechanically favouring the Players who have acquired the most Gold or Reputation. This means that every Pirate starts out with the same Equipment, Weapons and Ships that cannot be improved in any way. The only purpose for gaining Gold or leveling up with the various Trading Companies is to gain visual upgrades to show off your dedication to a certain Style or Faction by wearing themed Cosmetic Sets or showing off your hard earned Titles. To counterbalance this linear progression system, the game likes to keep its mouth shut about as many elements as possible, trusting the players to find out how to use different Tools or Equipment or even how to sail the Ship most efficiently by themselves or through communicating with Crew members or Enemies.</p>
